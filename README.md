# Transforming-Diabetes-Management-with-AI-and-ML-A-New-Era-of-Glycemic-Control

This project introduces an intelligent health monitoring system powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict and manage glycemic conditions efficiently. By combining medical data analysis with a user-friendly interface, it provides an innovative solution for the early detection and personalized management of diabetes.

🔍 Project Overview
The application classifies health input data as "likely glycemic" or "unlikely glycemic" using advanced machine learning models trained on clinical datasets. It analyzes a variety of features such as:

Age

Gender

Glucose level

Chloride concentration

Bicarbonate levels

Sodium and potassium levels

Blood pressure

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Insulin dosage

Lifestyle-related metrics (if available)

These inputs are processed to generate accurate predictions and insightful visual feedback.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Streamlit for interactive UI and visualization

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for dynamic charts and graphs

Anaconda Prompt to manage and run the project environment

📊 Features
